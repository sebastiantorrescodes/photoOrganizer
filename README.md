# photoOrganizer
This Python script creates a GUI application called JPG Exif Organizer using the tkinter library. It allows users to organize JPG files based on their EXIF metadata by renaming them and moving them to a newly created output folder.

Planning to use this code in order to create either a website or ios app.
